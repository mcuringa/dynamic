dynamic
=======

Example code for building simple dynamic websites with Python and Django.


This example code is meant to show novice programmers in the [Adelphi University Graduate Program in Educational Technology](http://education.adelphi.edu) the basics of dynamic web programming. In this sense, it differs a little bit from the best practices and conventions of Django, even though it is built using Django.

In particular, the students are learning:
- to process form data
- use templates to build dynamic sites
- basic object oriented design and programming
- how to store data using an object-relational mapper
